my
> Shows the locations you own, and your current location

view
> Shows the locations available. Put the location id after this to  view more information about the location

buy
> You have to options for buying: buy and liquidate, or just buy. If you put liqiudate at the end of the command, everything in your current location will be sold and the new one will be bought. Otherwise, you can keep everything in your old location

transfer
> This one is a bit complicated. The command can be broken down into three parts:

> [command] [animals] [location]

> Command:
> The beginning of the command. [prefix] location transfer

> Animals:
> A list of animals. Each item goes [amount] [animal]. Separate the items with commas and a space. (eg. 5 cow, 6 sheep, 1 chicken)

> Location:
> The name of the location you want to transfer the animals to

> You can also use [prefix] location transfer [location] to transfer yourself to that location

Each location has multipliers for different plants and animals, and some plants and animals will die in the wrong location!

You must complete all 3 contracts in 1 part before moving on to the next part.\n\n__`sign`__\nSign is for signing contracts. Once you have completed your current contract, you use this command to sign a new one.\n\n__`complete`__\nComplete is when you have gathered all the things for your current contract, and is ready to complete it and claim your reward.\n\n__`current`__\nCurrent shows the contract that you have signed currently.\n\nThat's about it for contracts. There are 4 parts of 3 contracts, for a total of 12. Also, you get a pretty cool item once you complete all the contracts.",						components=[
