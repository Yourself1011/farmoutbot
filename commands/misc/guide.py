	view

	buy
	> You have to options for buying: buy and liquidate, or just buy. If you put liqiudate at the end of the command, everything in your current location will be sold and the new one will be bought. Otherwise, you can keep everything in your old location

	transfer
	> This one is a bit complicated. The command can be broken down into three parts:

	> [command] [animals] [location]

	> Command:
	> The beginning of the command. [prefix] location transfer

	> Animals:
	> A list of animals. Each item goes [amount] [animal]. Separate the items with commas and a space. (eg. 5 cow, 6 sheep, 1 chicken)

	> Location:
	> The name of the location you want to transfer the animals to

	> You can also use [prefix] location transfer [location] to transfer yourself to that location

	Each location has multipliers for different plants and animals, and some plants and animals will die in the wrong location!
