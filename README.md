# Farmout
A currency bot where the player grows crops, takes care of animals, and trades with merchants to gain coins.

Farmout is a Currency/Fun bot where you own and take care of a farm.

There are tons of different animals that you can take care of, all giving you unique items like wool and milk. You have to plant and water seeds for crops, which you can sell and trade with the marketplace for other cool items. We’ve only recently added 2 new revolutionary updates: contracts and locations. These make the game feel more realistic, and make it feel like you are actually running a farm.
