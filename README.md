There are tons of different animals that you can take care of, all giving you unique items like wool and milk. You have to plant and water seeds for crops, which you can sell and trade with the marketplace for other cool items. We’ve only recently added 2 new revolutionary updates: repuation and locations. These make the game feel more realistic, and make it feel like you are actually running a farm.

With weekly updates, active devs, and an awesome community, there’s no reason not to try Farmout!
